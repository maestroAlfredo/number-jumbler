# number-jumbler

This is a web api as well as an mvc application that helps find the most frequently occuring number in a list. Upload a CSV file and see the magic.
The web api and the mvc application are all hosted on IIS
The api is able to also check if the input file is valid and give an error message.

THe documentation for the api is still being constructed. The MVC app and Web api use UNITY for DI. 

Updates coming sooon.... still writing unit tests as well.
